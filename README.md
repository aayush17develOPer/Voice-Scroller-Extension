# Voice-Scroller-Extension

This is a Chrome extension which allows user to scroll up or down a web page by saying "down" or "up"(note that saying in it's usual pronounciation didn't work at all times, so try saying the letters "u" "p" without gap if you want to scroll up, only in case the normal "up" command doesn't work. 

User gets the option to choose by how many pixels to scroll up or down on each command and you can also set the duration for which the voice recognition will be active.
In case of commands different than "up"/"down", nothing will happen.

My motivation for creating this extension is that during winters, at my home, when the temperatures drop really low , there are times when I feel lazy inside my cozy warm blanket but at the same time I want to scroll some e book or some webpage. I always felt inconvenient to take my hand outside again and again to scroll the window. This extension, will now come to my rescue. :)
